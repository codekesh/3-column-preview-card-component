## Overview

I made a project **3-column preview card component** using *Grid*. This is responsive site. I created 2 CSS styles files. One is (desktop_design.css) for desktop design and second is (mobile_design.css) for mobile view. Below mention are all the styles and refrence and my process on how to do this and what difficulties I were facing.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Make this project using grid
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Processes are mentioned here to make this site:
1. Created ID in html file in body section for **3-column preview card component**.
2. I created grid of 3 boxes.
3. In each box, I added icon, paragraph and button with common class, inserted background color and text color correspondingly.
4. I used hover in each box for active.
5. I used media queries for responsive website.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 267px 267px 267px;
    grid-template-rows: 410px;
    justify-content: center;
    margin: 150px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue this journey because lot of exploration is out there. This is my 3rd project using HTML, CSS but something is missing and that is JAVASCRIPT. I want to have a good practice in that also.
